# 📊 Student Performance Data Analysis

This project is a data analysis task on student exam performance using Python. It was created as part of an internship assignment at Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To analyze a dataset of student performance and answer key questions using Python, with focus on:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical analysis
- Basic data visualization

---

## 🗂 Dataset

**File:** `student-mat.csv`  
**Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)

This dataset includes attributes like:
- Grades: `G1`, `G2`, `G3`
- Study time, gender, absences, etc.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for documentation and execution

---

## 📌 Tasks Performed

1. **Data Loading**
   - Loaded CSV using Pandas
   - Displayed sample rows using `.head()`

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates
   - Stripped whitespace from columns
   - Checked and handled missing values

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Dataset shape and types
   - Descriptive statistics

4. **Statistical Questions Answered**
   - Average final grade (G3)
   - Number of students scoring above 15
   - Correlation between `studytime` and `G3`
   - Gender-wise average of final grade

5. **Visualizations**
   - Histogram of `G3`
   - Scatter plot: `studytime` vs `G3`
   - Bar chart: average `G3` by gender

---

## ✅ Outcome

- Learned how to handle real-world datasets
- Practiced essential data cleaning and visualization
- Understood how study time and gender may influence student performance
